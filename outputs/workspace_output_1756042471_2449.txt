Benefit Point
Detailed Explanation
Building equity for NextGen farmer
The incoming NextGen farmer is encouraged to acquire some equity which is a key desire, but usually out of reach, for many aspiring farmers across the country.
Attractive returns
Long term target of return of 10% p.a. comprising of approximately 6% of capital growth and up to 4% rental income
Robust Process
Firstly, NextGen farmers are vetted by Cultivate Farms and the retiring farmer before being matched onto the farm opportunity.
The AGRIMAAN platform is then used to list the properties and crowdfund the purchase price.
Investors can choose properties that interest them. Furthermore, 1 or more agricultural properties can be acquired by investors.
Opportunity to fractionally own the farm
Investors can participate in the fractional ownership of an agricultural property within the Next Generation Farmers Strategy which is then leased to both the retiring and aspiring farmer
Succession planning
The NextGen project provides a succession plan for retiring farmers to transition their farm to the next generation of farmers while seeing their farm scale to a higher level of productivity.
Facilitating a smooth transition
The retiring farmer will also retain some equity and stay farming in partnership with the NextGen farmer to ensure a smooth transition is achieved.
