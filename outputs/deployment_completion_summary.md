## Deployment Architecture

The deployment architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Frontend Container**: React application served through Nginx
2. **Backend Container**: Node.js Express API server
3. **MongoDB Container**: Database for the application
4. **Nginx Container**: Reverse proxy for SSL termination and load balancing
5. **Monitoring Containers**:
   - Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Grafana for visualization
   - Node Exporter for system metrics
   - MongoDB Exporter for database metrics

## Deployment Process

The deployment process is fully automated through the following steps:

1. **Server Preparation**:
   - Run `server_setup.sh` to prepare the server environment
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose
   - Configure firewall and security settings

2. **Application Deployment**:
   - Clone the repository to `/opt/agritech`
   - Configure environment variables in `.env` file
   - Run `deploy.sh` to build and start the application

3. **Monitoring Setup**:
   - Deploy monitoring stack with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d`
   - Configure Grafana dashboards
   - Set up alerts

4. **Verification**:
   - Verify all services are running with `docker-compose ps`
   - Check application functionality
   - Verify monitoring is working correctly

## Security Considerations

The deployment configuration includes several security measures:

1. **SSL/TLS Encryption**: All traffic is encrypted using SSL/TLS
2. **Secure Environment Variables**: Sensitive information is stored in environment variables
3. **Network Security**: Containers communicate through an isolated Docker network
4. **API Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of the API
5. **Web Application Firewall**: Configured in Nginx to protect against common attacks

## Scalability

The application can be scaled horizontally using the `scale.sh` script, which:

1. Creates a Docker Compose override file for scaling
2. Configures Nginx for load balancing
3. Allows independent scaling of frontend and backend services

## Backup and Recovery

A comprehensive backup and recovery system has been implemented:

1. **Automated Daily Backups**: MongoDB data is backed up daily
2. **Backup Retention**: Configurable retention period (default: 7 days)
3. **Manual Backup Option**: Can be triggered with `backup.sh`
4. **Restore Procedure**: Simple restore process using `restore.sh`

## Monitoring and Alerting

The monitoring system provides:

1. **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage, network traffic
2. **Application Metrics**: API response times, request rates, error rates
3. **Database Metrics**: Query performance, connection count, operation counts
4. **Alerting**: Configurable alerts for critical issues
5. **Visualization**: Grafana dashboards for all metrics

## Next Steps

The application is now fully prepared for deployment. The recommended next steps are:

1. **Staging Deployment**:
   - Deploy to a staging environment first
   - Verify all functionality
   - Test performance and security

2. **Production Deployment**:
   - Schedule a maintenance window
   - Follow the deployment checklist
   - Execute the deployment using the provided scripts
   - Verify deployment success

3. **Post-Deployment**:
   - Monitor application performance
   - Collect user feedback
   - Address any issues that arise

## Conclusion

All deployment preparation tasks have been successfully completed. The AgriTech application is now ready for deployment with a robust, scalable, and secure infrastructure. The comprehensive documentation and automated scripts ensure a smooth deployment process and ongoing maintenance.
