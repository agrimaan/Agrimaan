Executive Summary
Agriculture is the backbone of humanity. There is one thing common across the globe and that is food production and the consumption by people. When it comes to the quality of life, food is one the most critical parameters to assess and hence every country focuses on providing the required help to their farmers in order to produce quality crops.
There are so many universities, NGOs, private sectors as well as international organisations such as the United Nations who do so much research to help these farmers predict the weather, demand for the good and plan accordingly. There are so many tools and software products helping the farmers in a few advanced countries to use Drones and IoT (Internet of Things) like technology and the results are extraordinary.
Farming is one part of the supply chain it comes to connecting producers to consumers. Unfortunately, there is so much content on the web that no one knows exactly what to refer to and what to ignore. On top of it, there are so many intermediaries who have got their vested interest not to educate the core members in the supply chain to bring transparency. 
The supply chain has got another big challenge. It requires innovation at every step in the chain. Technologies like Blockchain to implement DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) is one aspect, Machine Learning for predictive analytics, Big Data to process the data sent by so many parties, IoT to use sensors for Smart Farming and Artificial Intelligence using Neural Networking. Most of these are not known to several participants in the supply chain and hence most of the time chain breaks.
Agrimaan  is the initiative to solve this problem and bring everyone on a common platform. Agrimaan™ acts like a superhero for them and it is termed as Agriculture Innovation using Machine Learning, Applied Analytics and Neural Networking. 
This concept paper has been detailed out to provide the product design guideline and the implementation roadmap in a phased manner.


Agriculture Domain Understanding
What is Sustainable Agriculture?
In a simple term, Sustainable agriculture is all about meeting the requirement of food for the society without compromising the future generation. Sustainable agricultural systems benefit the environment by reducing soil degradation and erosion, maintaining soil quality and saving water. 
Sustainable agriculture includes sustainable ways of farming based on the study of the relationship between organisms and environmental understanding of ecosystem services. The overall crops produced through sustainable agriculture by stewardship of natural and human resources are more healthy and nutritious. The interconnection between farming and other environmental  aspects can be explored by using the tools and processes used in sustainable agriculture. 
Stewardship of human resources considers present and future social responsibilities of the needs of rural communities, living and working conditions of labourers, consumer health and safety while for land and natural resources maintaining or enhancing the vital resources are necessary. 						
Importance of Sustainable Agriculture
Practitioners integrate and apply sustainable agriculture for three main objectives. These are a healthy environment, economic profitability and social equity. Every grower, food processor, distributor, retailers, waste managers and consumers involved in the agricultural system plays an essential role in ensuring a sustainable environment. The common practices in sustainable agriculture and food systems include growers; using methods to minimize water wastage, promoting soil health and reducing pollution levels in the farm; 
retailers and consumers concerned with sustainable value-based foods grown to promote farmers wellbeing; and researchers; crossing disciplinary lines, combining chemistry, economics, biology, genetic engineering, community development and many other fields. The broad theme of strategies are based on the range of potential ideas in three separate but related areas of concern in farming and natural resources; plant and animal production practices; political, social and economic context representing and interpreting the vision of sustainable agriculture.
Sustainable agriculture consists of a collection of practices and processes of negotiating competing interests of individual farmers and community members to solve complex problems related to food and fibre crops. The goal of sustainable agriculture is to meet current needs without sacrificing future prospects by protecting water quality and supply; sustainable land use while maintaining biodiversity and wildlife habitat; resorting to renewable ways of energy production and consumption; improving plant, animal production and labour practices to ensure social and economic equity. The systemic approach implies interdisciplinary inputs and efforts from researchers, farmers, consumers, policymakers and other stakeholders from various disciplines. The process of transitioning to sustainable agriculture for farmers requires a series of small and realistic steps based on personal goals and family economics.
Traditional Farming Types
Here are seven different types of traditional farming:

Precision Farming or Precision Agriculture
Precision agriculture is a modern farming practice which involves observing, measuring and responding to intra and inter-field crop variability. It is also called satellite farming with a site-specific crop farming management concept that makes the production process more efficient. Precision farming is employed to accurately manage field variations, reduces production costs and improves food yield using fewer resources. Precision agriculture allows growers and farmers to work with better soil in larger fields and manages them as a group of small fields. Precision farming involves strategic ways of guiding farmers in crop rotation, optimal planting or harvesting times and soil management to improve crop productivity and efficiency while reducing environmental impact.
Precision agriculture uses information technology to ensure optimum health and productivity of soil to meet crop requirements. The farmers require technical support and assistance for technology application of precision farming that combines the use of sensors, GPS (global positioning systems), robots, mapping tools and data-analytics in agricultural production like site-specific pesticide application, pest scouting, variable-rate irrigation or yield mapping to improve plant growth without increasing labour. The aim of precision farming is to minimize environmental impact but maximize economic return by optimizing crop yield and using optimum field-level management practices and advanced crop science technology to match the needs of farmers.
Importance of Precision Farming
Use of precision agricultural practices is needed to apply water, nutrients and other agricultural inputs on crops grown in a wide range of soil environments depending on the basis of research on soil types, soil characteristics, soil temperature and humidity, weather patterns, growth factors and other parameters; helping farmers to increase productivity. Crop rotation applied to improve diversity and to monitor harvest time or irrigation rates along with technology, making modern agriculture more efficient. Farmers are able to use global positioning systems, GPS-computer guided tractors and other geo-referenced site-specific practices like electromagnetic soil mapping, soil sample collection, crop yield data collection, aerial imagery, crop or soil colour index maps and drainage level studies; increasing potential yields. Increase in use of geo-referenced data layers helping to subdivide large fields into small management zones, increasing crop production potential and farm efficiency. It also helps to manage time and saves water; reduces waste, environmental dangers and avoids misapplication of products.
Environmental variation in soil, weather, vegetation, water and other factors that determine the growth of healthy crops and higher yield are considered for farming success and conservation of natural resources. The goal of precision farming is to reduce potential environmental risks and improved agricultural yield which could be achieved by monitoring physicochemical parameters of soil and plant through sensors; continuous monitoring and real-time data collection of parameters by application of sensing devices in fields providing updated status to maintain optimal conditions for plant growth; and using integrated farm management techniques to improve productivity. This helps in saving time and cost; managing decisions by keeping farm records and reduces environmental pollution.
Biodynamic Farming
Biodynamic farming was first introduced in Germany in 1924 by Dr Rudolf Steiner to combat rapid degeneration of soil, deterioration of food quality and seed viability and vitality that occurred due to chemical farming. Chemical farming is a consequence of world wars when the residues of chemicals used in warfare and weapon manufacturing were used against plant pests and weeds. Introduction of hybrid seeds and genetically modified seeds posed a great threat to the ecological balance on the earth. With many global disasters happening around due to the damage caused to our planet, people are becoming aware of sustainable practices.
Biodynamics is concerned with how life on earth is influenced by the higher forces and the finer energies. Today, many people around the world validated this concept, attempted to document the effect of cosmos on Earth and published planting calendars for farmers and gardeners. This method is purely based on observation and relationship with nature.
Biodynamic farming is slowly gaining popularity across the world over the past few decades. Steiner presented farmers an altogether different way of looking at farming and earth in general and inter-relationships and interactions between all living things. He explained that chemical agriculture is a mere study of dead things in laboratories rather than observation of nature and interactions therein. He also believed that moving planets and stars have an impact on the life of plants, animals and human beings and that this very connection helps us understand how to work best with nature in a scientific way. The whole concept behind this is that these forces bring balance to the soil and the plants that grow in the soil and every living being that consume those plants.
Principles of biodynamic farming
Biodynamic farming considers the following aspects to bring about a balance between all elements that support life:
Life depends largely on the interaction of substance and energies. For instance, we eat food which provides us with energy.
The plants that are grown in a well-balanced soil can give us substance as well as energy
Competent use of organic matter enriches the soil
Humus which is the fully digested crude organic matter maintains the fertility of the soil in a stable way
Using cow dung for making compose owing to the presence of more beneficial bacteria attributed to the lengthy digestion process of cow
