• Recent crop issues
• Weather information for monitored regions


Key features:
• Summary statistics cards
• Field health status table
• Recent crop issues table
• Pending recommendations table
• Weather information display


2. FieldAnalysis.tsx

A detailed field analysis component that allows agronomists to:
• View comprehensive field information
• Analyze soil health indicators
• Monitor crop growth and health
• Track weather impact on fields
• View inspection history


Key features:
• Tabbed interface for different analysis categories
• Soil health indicators with ratings
• Crop health status monitoring
• Weather impact analysis
• Inspection history tracking


3. Recommendations.tsx

A component for managing agricultural recommendations that enables agronomists to:
• Create new recommendations for farmers
• Track recommendation status
• Filter recommendations by various criteria
• Edit and delete recommendations


Key features:
• Comprehensive filtering options
• Status tracking with visual indicators
• Priority-based organization
• CRUD operations for recommendations


Routing Implementation

The App.tsx file has been updated to include routes for the Agronomist role:

{/* Agronomist Routes */}
<Route path="/agronomist" element={isAuthenticated && user?.role === 'agronomist' ? <Layout /> : <Navigate to="/login" />}>
  <Route index element={<AgronomistDashboard />} />
  <Route path="fields/:id" element={<FieldAnalysis />} />
  <Route path="recommendations" element={<Recommendations />} />
  <Route path="profile" element={<Profile />} />
  <Route path="settings" element={<Settings />} />
</Route>


Data Models

The implementation includes the following data models:


Field

interface Field {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  location: string;
  size: number;
  unit: string;
  owner: {
    _id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    phone: string;
  };
  crops: Array<{
    _id: string;
    name: string;
    variety: string;
    plantingDate: string;
    expectedHarvestDate: string;
    status: string;
    healthStatus: string;
  }>;
  soilType: string;
  soilHealth: {
    ph: number;
    nitrogen: number;
    phosphorus: number;
    potassium: number;
    organicMatter: number;
    moisture: number;
  };
  lastInspection: string;
  healthStatus: string;
  weatherConditions: object;
  inspectionHistory: Array<object>;
}


Recommendation

interface Recommendation {
  _id: string;
  field: {
    _id: string;
    name: string;
  };
  farmer: {
    _id: string;
    name: string;
  };
  type: string;
  description: string;
  details: string;
  status: string;
  priority: string;
  createdAt: string;
  dueDate: string;
  implementedDate?: string;
  feedback?: string;
}


Consultation

interface Consultation {
  _id: string;
  farmer: {
    _id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
  };
  field?: {
    _id: string;
    name: string;
  };
  topic: string;
  status: string;
  scheduledDate: string;
  notes?: string;
}


CropIssue

interface CropIssue {
  _id: string;
  field: {
    _id: string;
    name: string;
  };
  farmer: {
    _id: string;
    name: string;
  };
  crop: {
    _id: string;
    name: string;
    variety: string;
  };
  issueType: string;
  description: string;
  severity: string;
  status: string;
  reportedDate: string;
}


Features Implemented

1. Dashboard Overview
• Summary statistics for monitored fields, recommendations, consultations, and crop issues
• Quick access to common tools and functions
• Weather information display for monitored regions


2. Field Monitoring
• Comprehensive field health status tracking
• Soil health analysis with ratings for different parameters
• Crop growth stage monitoring


3. Recommendation System
• Creation and management of recommendations for farmers
• Status tracking for recommendations (pending, accepted, rejected, implemented)
• Priority-based organization (low, medium, high, urgent)
• Filtering and search capabilities


4. Data Visualization
• Tabular data presentation for fields, recommendations, and crop issues
• Status indicators using color-coded chips
• Progress indicators for crop growth stages


Mock Data Implementation

The components currently use mock data to simulate API responses. In a production environment, these would be replaced with actual API calls to the backend server.


Next Steps

1. Additional Components
• Create CropHealth.tsx component for detailed crop health monitoring
• Implement Consultations.tsx for managing farmer consultations
• Add RecommendationForm.tsx for creating and editing recommendations


2. Backend Integration
• Implement API endpoints for agronomist-specific operations
• Connect frontend components to backend APIs
• Add authentication and authorization for agronomist routes


3. Enhanced Features
• Implement image upload for field and crop inspections
• Add notification system for urgent issues
• Implement reporting and analytics features
• Add calendar integration for consultation scheduling


Conclusion

The Agronomist dashboard implementation provides a solid foundation for agricultural experts to monitor fields, analyze crop health, and provide recommendations to farmers. The modular design allows for easy extension and enhancement of features in the future.
