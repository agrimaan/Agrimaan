# MongoDB Integration and API Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to integrate MongoDB and replace mock data with real API calls in the Agrimaan application.

## Backend Changes

### 1. MongoDB Connection
- Created a dedicated MongoDB connection module in `backend/config/db.js`
- Updated the server.js file to use the connection module
- Added environment variable `USE_REAL_DB=true` to enable real database usage

### 2. Authentication
- Updated the auth middleware to use real JWT verification and user lookup
- Removed development-mode bypasses for authentication
- Updated the admin middleware to properly check user roles

### 3. Data Models
- Utilized existing MongoDB models for User, Fields, Crop, Sensor, and Order
- Created a new MarketplaceItem model for marketplace functionality

### 4. API Routes
- Implemented marketplace routes in `backend/routes/marketplace.routes.js`
- Updated server.js to include the new marketplace routes
- Ensured all routes use proper authentication and authorization

### 5. Seed Data
- Created a comprehensive seed script in `backend/scripts/seedData.js`
- Added sample data for users, fields, crops, sensors, and orders
- Implemented proper relationships between entities

### 6. MongoDB Setup
- Created a setup script in `backend/scripts/setupMongoDB.sh`
- Added instructions for MongoDB installation and configuration
- Ensured proper data directory creation and permissions

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Authentication Service
- Updated `authSlice.ts` to use real API calls instead of mock data
- Implemented proper token storage and management
- Added error handling for authentication failures

### 2. API Integration
- Ensured all API calls use the correct base URL
- Added proper error handling for API failures
- Implemented loading states for API operations

### 3. New Redux Slices
- Created `orderSlice.ts` for order management functionality
- Created `marketplaceSlice.ts` for marketplace functionality
- Updated the Redux store to include the new slices

### 4. Configuration
- Updated API configuration to use the correct backend URL
- Ensured consistent error handling across all API calls

## Documentation

### 1. README Updates
- Added MongoDB setup instructions
- Updated installation and running instructions
- Added information about default users and credentials
- Included details about the database seed script

### 2. Scripts
- Created a start script to run both MongoDB and the application
- Made scripts executable with proper permissions
- Added error handling and logging to scripts

## Testing
- Verified MongoDB connection and operations
- Tested authentication with real database users
- Validated API endpoints with real data
- Ensured proper error handling for edge cases

## Next Steps
1. **Complete API Testing**: Test all API endpoints with various scenarios
2. **Enhance Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for API failures
3. **Add Data Validation**: Implement more comprehensive data validation
4. **Optimize Database Queries**: Review and optimize MongoDB queries for performance
5. **Implement Caching**: Add caching for frequently accessed data
6. **Add Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
7. **Set Up Monitoring**: Add monitoring for database performance and API health
